# ReactJS

## First up

Remember when I said HTML can be created by javascript files? What if I tell you there is a thing that helps you manage all your javascript \(Imma call them js from now on\) and html code?

Enter **ReactJS**. Developed by Facebook \(of all people\), React is

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

At this point I think I should backtrack a bit and elaborate on this user interface thingy.

## One more thing before we talk about React

### So. Web development.

What is it? What does it do? How are we gonna understand THE THING?

Now, most of the time when we refer to "web develpment", we're talking about the process of developing something, well, on the web! And that something, if it's not a static webpage/site, is mostly what we called **web-apps** \(or webapps or web apps. Whatever\).

{% hint style="info" %}
When a website does nothing other than display information, with no interaction whatsoever, we'll call it **static**. 

Otherwise, when the content or its look **changes dynamically** upon interaction with the viewer \(you\), much like what an app does, we can call them a **web-app**.
{% endhint %}

### Frontend and Backend

You might have heard it but there are two parts to developing a web-app \(probably more but those are the two main parts\): **frontend** and **backend**.

Think about the apps that you're using. Any one. There's the part that you see, you touch \(if it's a phone app\), you click \(if you use a mouse\), you hear \(幫肯恩業配一下kkbox\). Then there's the part underneath the surface that does the calculations and controls what content is shown to you.

We call the layer that helps us communicate with computers the **User Interface**. Or **UI** for short. This part is usually done by the **frontend** part of code/development team.

{% hint style="info" %}
Not to be confused with **UX**, User Experience.
{% endhint %}

What we don't see directly in an app is where the app either communicates with the server \(wherever it is\),  the way the app determines what content it shows us \(looking at you, YouTube algorithm\), and many more. While the UI provides a platform to present contents, what the **backend** part does is determine when and what content the app should let us see.

I personally understand frontend and backend as this: 

* Frontend: where and how we see stuff, deals with html, css, and browser stuff
* Backend: when and what stuff we see, deals with database and calculations

They say there's no standard way to differentiate between frontend and backend, so just having a rough idea is enough.

### Who's that guy sitting there doing all the work?

Remember, there's this kind of creature that is able to do both frontend and backend stuff and finish a project all on their own. Yes, they exist.

So we, like all human beings since Adam and Eve, ought to name them. And what name did we come up with? \(drum roll please\) **Full stack developer**!!! Horray!!
