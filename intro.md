# Circle Coding Intro

Circle was created by Ken Cheng and the main goal of this organization is to share knowledge and experience to junior Taiwanese students. And Circle coding is to help students with interests of coding.

This semester we will host several workshops to briefly go through javascript and start with several projects.

1. Finish TSA website member system
2. Revise previous projects
3. Help Business Faculty to build up a teaching website for Data Analysis \(with good pay\)

Members who participated in last year should go through and understand the material I list in \(Optional\).

In the middle of this semester, there will be a small task to test your coding ability and decide which project you need to work on.
